# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This week‚Äôs challenge was to create a weather dashboard using a weather API.

In the beginning of the challenge I sat down and physically wrote on a piece of paper pseudo-code steps that I would have to do in order to get a decent idea on how to approach this.

The weather API‚Äôs documentation was pretty easy to understand, however pulling and displaying the proper information from the information array gave me more trouble than I thought. The majority of the time I was figuring out which object contained certain data.

Appending the data and displaying on the html was fun, there wasn‚Äôt much time left to style so it looks very bare bones. Unfortunately I did not complete some of the criteria.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
